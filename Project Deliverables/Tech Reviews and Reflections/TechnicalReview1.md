## Background and context

Skateboarders have very specific preferences as to how their boards feel and handle. Each boarderâ€™s unique style drives their requirement for how stiff their board is. In addition, different skateboarders vary in weight; decks that are too stiff for a light rider could be too flexible for a heavy one. Currently, riders chasing the perfect board have to rely on brute-force experimentation, buying multiple decks to find one with the perfect stiffness.

Our project is a tool that takes in desired board size, rider weight, and riding style and generates a skateboard geometry for the user to take to a laser cutter or 3D cad program. Ideally, our project will have a web interface that takes in user parameters and returns a render of a board design custom tailored to the user with CAD geometry over the web.

## Key questions

- Imagine yourself as a user of our website. When you open the webpage, what do you expect to see?
- What do you want to see when you have finished entering all the information and how should it be displayed?
- Do you prefer a 3D rendering or 2D cut file?
- Where are our biggest risks?

## Agenda for technical review session

- Explain the skateboard product and variables that affect its functionality (2 minutes)
- Provide explanation of the software architecture we plan to implement(3 minutes)
- Gather user UI expectations (5 minutes)
- Gather feedback on 2D vs 3D rendering (5 minutes)
- Gather feedback on program risks we may be missing(5 minutes)
