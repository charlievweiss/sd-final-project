   <center><h1>Welcome to Skateboard Designer!</h1></center>
   <h2>Skateboarders have very specific preferences as to how their boards feel and handle. Each boarderâ€™s unique style drives their requirement for how stiff their board is. In addition, different skateboarders vary in weight; decks that are too stiff for a light rider could be too flexible for a heavy one. Currently, riders chasing the perfect board have to rely on brute-force experimentation, buying multiple decks to find one with the perfect stiffness. <br><br>

   Skateboard Designer is a tool that takes in desired board size, rider weight, and riding style and generates a skateboard geometry for the user to take to a laser cutter or 3D cad program. Ideally, our project will have a web interface that takes in user parameters and returns a render of a board design custom tailored to the user with CAD geometry over the web.</h2>
