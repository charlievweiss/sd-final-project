# TR2 - Reflection &amp; Synthesis

**Feedback and decisions**  **Based upon your notes from the technical review, synthesize the feedback you received addressing your key questions. How do you plan to incorporate it going forward? What new questions did you generate?**

Going into this review, we had been struggling to figure out how to best make the outline of the board to CAD creation. As per Oliver&#39;s suggestion in the review, we have decided to move forward with approximating the spline with a series of tiny lines. This will be fairly easy to accomplish and render a final product that is still nearly perfect for the level of accuracy that we need.

After looking into some of the solutions proposed in the review, we&#39;ve decided to downscope our application to run locally instead  of deploying to the web. This downscope was driven by the high complexity of the solutions proposed in the review, in addition to a manpower limitation - Charlie will most likely not be able to contribute for the near future due to a concussion.

We also received some good feedback on our coding practices and will be cleaning up our code to make it more professional and readable. Specifically we will be moving all of our import statements to the top of the main script.

**Review process reflection**  **How did the review go? Did you get answers to your key questions? Did you provide too much/too little context for your audience? Did you stick closely to your planned agenda, or did you discover new things during the discussion that made you change your plans? What could you do next time to have an even more effective technical review?**

We were excited to share our progress with everyone and show off what we have been working on. The response was mostly positive and people were overall helpful in providing feedback, although we don&#39;t feel that this technical review was as beneficial as our previous. This was likely due in part to the fact that we have a better idea of our direction at this point in the project. Coming into the review we felt that we needed to be a little more technical and show off our code. We centered our key questions around more technical roadblocks, however, this likely made it difficult for students to engage more in the presentation. If we were to do another technical review we would incorporate some more freethinking, generative brainstorming questions into the mix. Otherwise, we kept to the agenda throughout the presentation and received feedback on the biggest risks in our project&#39;s success, discussing the feasibility of web deployment and ability to generate certain geometric models.
