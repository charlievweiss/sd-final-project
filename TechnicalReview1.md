## Background and context

Skateboarders have very specific preferences as to how their boards feel and handle. Each boarder’s unique style drives their requirement for how stiff their board is. In addition, different skateboarders vary in weight; decks that are too stiff for a light rider could be too flexible for a heavy one. Currently, riders chasing the perfect board have to rely on brute-force experimentation, buying multiple decks to find one with the perfect stiffness.

Our project is a tool that takes in desired board size, rider weight, and riding style and generates a skateboard geometry for the user to take to a laser cutter or 3D cad program. Ideally, our project will have a web interface that takes in user parameters and returns a render of a board design custom tailored to the user with CAD geometry over the web.

## Key questions

- Imagine yourself as a user of our website. When you open the webpage, what do you expect to see?
- What do you want to see when you have finished entering all the information and how should it be displayed?
- Do you prefer a 3D rendering or 2D cut file?
- Where are our biggest risks?

## Agenda for technical review session

- Explain the skateboard product and variables that affect its functionality (2 minutes)
- Provide explanation of the software architecture we plan to implement(3 minutes)
- Gather user UI expectations (5 minutes)
- Gather feedback on 2D vs 3D rendering (5 minutes)
- Gather feedback on program risks we may be missing(5 minutes)
