**Feedback and decisions**

We received some great feedback on what people expect or want the interaction with the app to be. We found that people care a lot about wait time. People would rather see fake renderings that are somewhat close then have to wait a while to see true renderings of the deck geometry. Because of this, we think it may be useful to split the real-time feedback a user sees as they change the inputs and the final output, depending on how long it takes to generate the final output.

We also received ideas for many interesting features we can add after making sure the app is functional, such as:

-&quot;Skate Science&quot; info, or how shape,length,and flex will affect the ride characteristics of a deck

-Instructions for Manufacturing

-Hover-overs for more information on inputs

-Information about how the specific output was generated

The biggest risk that came up was web deployment. Going forward, we need to understand how to design the app so that the extra libraries we&#39;re using and integration with OpensCAD will still function when we deploy to the web. This could drive architectural changes.

**Review process reflection**

We felt that the review went overall quite well. We got answers to our key questions. We stuck to planned agenda for the most part, but when we drifted, it was because we were getting really useful feedback. We now have a better idea of what people want to see from the website. There were many things we didn&#39;t consider before (such as descriptions of how each input would affect the ultimate board design) that would turn this app from good to great. The biggest thing we would change to have a more effective review would be to have more code to discuss, so we could have better technical feedback. Though getting user feedback was valuable, we understand that we&#39;re still sitting on a fair amount of technical risk, and having better developed code to bring to the review would have helped to reduce that risk.
